<h2 class="section-heading">SPEAK FOR YOURSELF!</h2>

<p><blockquote><i>When you lend him your ears, John Kageche has the rare and amazing talent for breaking down speeches. He is able to see what is usually overlooked -- especially in message development he will see the whole program and how your message fits into it; his ability to combine ones personality with one's message is especially refreshing for any speaker to forge emotional bonds with their audiences. When you explore a speech with Kageche, you discover a whole a new world, full of your new self, and full of delightful “aha” moments and fun.</i><br>
<b>Jagi Gakunju, Group CEO, AAR</b></blockquote>

Have you been at the receiving end of a painful public address? Most probably, yes. Pain is when you are subjected to listening to a drone of a voice devoid of content and direction in the name of a public address. Whether presenting your thesis, defending your proposal, addressing the board, a rally, a congregation, or funeral gathering, the ability to get the audience to comprehend what you are saying while keeping them awake and responsive is pegged to scientifically proven tools and techniques which you can harness. Speak for Yourself! and give much needed relief to audiences accustomed to being on the receiving end of a painful address.<br><br>

Also included:<br><br>
<b>Message Development:</b> You know how to and what to say but need assistance fleshing out the message.<br><br>

<b>Speech Writing:</b> Craft a speech and coach you to delivering it in your style.<br><br>

The program is offered in one on one, small group sessions or targeted clinics</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">SALES SOLUTIONS FOR YOUR ORGANIZATION</h2>

<p>One size cannot fit all. The sales skills set for a business to customer (B2C) service industry are different from those of an FMCG or oil industry and both different still from B2B selling. For instance, selling a bank account and selling elevators have widely varied sales cycles and require different skills. It is for this reason that we prefer crafting a program depending on your needs.

<blockquote><i>He didn’t need to say it but it was quickly obvious to me that Kageche was not sharing theory with my sales team. His practical style of delivery had all the hallmarks of one who had been to the trenches. I found him a great educator, totally engaging, with contagious enthusiasm. We witnessed unprecedented growth after lending him our ears and, more importantly, as senior management, were forced to relook our sales strategy, based on our interactions with him. He’s reliable professional and a real pleasure to work with.</i><br>

<h2 class="section-heading">FACILITATION</h2>

<p>
This is not a program but a service we offer.<br>

<blockquote><i>John Kageche conceptualized and facilitated a turn-around sales conference for KETEPA in which my heads of department and myself were present; the objectives were well articulated and I consider the conference a success.</i><br>
<b>Collins Cheruiyot, MD, KETEPA</b></blockquote><br><br>

Everyday people meet to discuss issues and challenges. Such discussions could take the form of conferences, symposiums or talk shows. For instance, a company could be meeting for an annual sales conference; a board could be meeting to discuss strategy or budget; a panel discussion could be held by local business persons and wananchi to discuss the way forward for the county; maybe even your church planning committee could be meeting to discuss whether to start a school or how to grow the existing fledgling one; it could be a focus group put together to obtain feedback ahead of rolling out a prototype or just a brainstorming session.<br> <br>

All such fora require a leader with specific skills set. This leader must remain neutral throughout the forum. He must be someone who can clearly and concisely present the topic of discussion, encourage participation from everyone while handling challenging situations, control the meeting, keep it focused and assist members arrive at a decision if that’s what the forum calls for; in other instances, the facilitator simply sees to it that the issue or problem is discussed. We offer such facilitation.
