<h2 class="section-heading">I am an educator, trainer, writer, speaker and facilitator.</h2>

<p>I help institutions grow their bottom line by empowering their front line with tools and techniques to make them more productive yet still responsible. </p>

<p>I also help individuals improve their presentation skills, public speaking ability and speech writing techniques; whether at CEO orÂ in any leadership position, the simple and immediately implementable techniques you will learn will propel you further along becoming a better speaker and leader. Anyone who finds themselves with the need to address an audience can benefit; students defending thier thesis, employees defending thier proposals or clergymen addressing thier congregation. If you are in leadership position, it is difficult to lead without the ability to communicate with audiences. </p>

<p><b><i>You are thus left with two choices: be born with the ability or lend us your ears and learn</i></b></p>
